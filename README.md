BlanketLearn makes you grasp the basics in the above mentioned subject. Made for anyone of all ages above 12 to learn something that they weren't taught or for someone who wants to relearn forgotten skills. The lectures are based on the school curriculum to ensure the best quality. 
# Made for the InfoKup competition in Croatia for the category "Razvoj Softvera"
BlanketLearn was created by me (Tonči Crljen) for the InfoKup competition of the 7th and 8th grade. I absolutely love ICT and one day descided "why not register to the competition?" and here we are today! The InfoKup website can be found at https://informatika.azoo.hr/
# Future plans
× Add more topics and lectures to the site

× Make educational videos describing the individual lectures

× Add Firebase backend and then deploy it onto the internet for everyone to enjoy

× Add more subjects (physics, geography, maybe maths)

× Add an authentication and account managing system with Firebase

× Add a counter displaying how many lectures have you done in a perticular group
